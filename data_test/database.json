Twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise Finch--\"Scout\"--returns home from New York City to visit her aging father, Atticus. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise's homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town and the people dearest to her. Memories from her childhood flood back, and her values and assumptions are thrown into doubt. Featuring many of the iconic characters from To Kill a Mockingbird, Go Set a Watchman perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in a painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past--a journey that can be guided only by one's conscience.\r\n\r\nWritten in the mid-1950s, Go Set a Watchman imparts a fuller, richer understanding and appreciation of Harper Lee. Here is an unforgettable novel of wisdom, humanity, passion, humor and effortless precision--a profoundly affecting work of art that is both wonderfully evocative of another era and relevant to our own times.

What really intrigues me about Puzo's presentation of the Corleone family, and something that does not translate as explicitly to the screen, is the incredible sense of moral and religious conviction that what they do is right and good. At times I found myself believing that the Corleone's were right to be who they were, or at the very least, that such a way of life in de-centralized Sicily, if not in 20th century America, was appropriate. Puzo does everything in this book; action, drama, romance, epic, humanity, pulp, and he does it all effortlessly. One minute you're reading about a fictional mafioso and the next minute you realize you've stumbled on one of the great literary accomplishments of the century.
